# weather-app
A mini-weather API using Vagrant, Python, SQLite, and Puppet


# To-Do List
* Get basic DB functionality up (mostly done, may need cleanup)
* Get basic API call functionality up (doing now)
* Get it to run on a vagrant server
* Sort out puppet things

# Extension Ideas
* Play with in-memory DB, see if that's lighter and appropriate to the task
* How to lighten this repo
